<h1>When Jonathan “Joff” Beckett was 18 years old he left the confines of his comfortable Norfolk, home in England to explore the Caribbean.</h1>

<p>Today, at 59, Beckett is still traversing the globe as chief executive of Burgess, a yacht broker that sells luxury boats to wealthy people around the world. He’s rarely in a city for more than a week, but he does have three places that he calls home, at least so far as his work homes: London, near where his wife and two young children live; Monaco, the location of his company's head office; and New York, where many yacht enthusiasts reside.</p>

<div id="footer">
	When he’s not in those cities, he’s spending a day or two in places like Australia, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia. Beckett loves the travel, he said, but he's most comfortable in his own space. “I look forward to being any of those three places,” he said, adding that he usually spends a week at each every month. “Especially when I’m with my family.”
