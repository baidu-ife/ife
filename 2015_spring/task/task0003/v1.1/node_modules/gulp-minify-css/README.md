[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin to minify CSS, using [clean-css] 

## Regarding Issues

This is just a simple [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin, which means it's nothing more than a thin wrapper around `clean-css`. If it looks like you are having CSS related issues, please contact [clean-css]. Only create a new issue if it looks like you're having a problem with the plugin itself.

## Installation

[Use npm.](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

```
npm install --save-dev gulp-minify-css
```

## API

```javascript
var minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css');
```

### minifyCss([*options*])

*options*: `Object`  
Return: `Object` ([stream.Tansform](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform))

Options are directly passed to [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css#how-to-use-clean-css-programmatically) so all clean-css options are available.

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css');

gulp.task('minify-css', function() {
  return gulp.src('styles/*.css')
    .pipe(minifyCss({compatibility: 'ie8'}))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

[Source Maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) can be generated by using [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps).

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var minifyCss = require('gulp-minify-css');
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.task('minify-css', function() {
  return gulp.src('./src/*.css')
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(minifyCss())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```
